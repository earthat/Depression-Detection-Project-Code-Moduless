Objective
Coding blogs with explanations of concepts and code for each module. The blogs will be shared on medium.com. Blogger will also be responsible for sharing the blogs n 5-10 social
media platforms or pages.  LinkedIn is a must. The same blogger will be responsible for writing a full product description for this product on our website. 

Example of coding blog: https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/
Website product example: https://free-thesis.com/product/modified-leach-protocol-with-gwo-optimization-in-wsn/

Module4: Graph Topology-based Depression Detection 
Structure to write the blog
1.	Introduction about the topic (from ref paper)
2.	Challenges in the depression detection (from ref paper)
3.	Justify the Requirement of the graph topology for this (original data website as in paper)
4.	Explain the process of from the paper
5.	Code Description with code snippets with visualization
6.	Link of the product on our website to download the code
7.	Link of the previous all blogs modules too

Website Product Description
Generate collectively from above modules

Note
1.	The blog titles should be relevant to the audience with highly catchy keywords, not only specific to the reference paper.
2.	Content will be proof read first before publication
3.	No AI tool and paraphrasing should be used
4.	AI plagiarism will be checked using Turnitin AI detector and content would be straight away discarded.
